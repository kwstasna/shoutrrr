 *
 * Behaviour confirmed 2026: X collapses runs of line breaks down to a single
 * blank line; LinkedIn's feed keeps at most one blank line between paragraphs;
 * Bluesky stores and renders standard newlines untouched. Facebook, Instagram,
 * and Threads use the same single-blank-line default as X/LinkedIn. Discord
 * renders consecutive newlines verbatim (like Bluesky), and the webhook
 * connector publishes the raw content, so the preview must preserve them too.
 * Tune a value here if a platform changes how it collapses spacing.
